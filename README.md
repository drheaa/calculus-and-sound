## 🔍 Core Concepts Covered

### ➤ Feature Extraction
- Calculus helps calculate **amplitude change** (derivatives) and **energy in a sound signal** (integrals).
- Applications: speech recognition, audio classification.

### ➤ Machine Learning & Gradient Descent
- Derivatives are used to optimize models that detect audio patterns.

### ➤ Spectral Analysis
- Identifies key frequency components of sound signals.
- Used in seismic analysis and audio fingerprinting.

### ➤ Fourier Transform
- Converts sound from time domain to frequency domain.
- Enables sound visualization and filtering.

### ➤ Signal Processing
- Tools like **convolution**, **differentiation**, and **integration** are used for noise reduction and detecting changes.

### ➤ Musical Scale and Synthesis
- Music theory is deeply rooted in frequency ratios.
- Synthesizers allow manipulation of sound functions — slope, curve steepness, and more — using mathematical controls.
